                Many tag and attribute names have been changed to make their purpose
                more clear. Several examples of this include: the <em>div</em> tag being
                changed to <em>Container</em>, the <em>a</em> tag being changed to
                <em>Link</em>, the <em>p</em> being changed to <em>Text</em>, and
                the <em>href</em> attribute being changed to <em>destination</em>.
            </p>

                Readability
            </p>
            <p>
                Gossamer uses more verbose language as opposed to shortened language
                in order to increase readability. For example, instead of using <em>src</em>
                to specify an image's location, you use <em>source</em>.

                Looking at a wall of HTML is not the most pleasant feeling. Gossamer
                forces tags to be spaced out more, which makes the code less intimidating.
                Gossamer also makes web code more C or Java like in style, making it
                feel more familiar to novice programmers.
